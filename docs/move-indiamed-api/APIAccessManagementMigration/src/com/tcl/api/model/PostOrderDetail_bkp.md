## 1. High‑Level Summary
`PostOrderDetail_bkp` is a plain‑old‑Java‑Object (POJO) that represents the full set of attributes returned (or sent) for a “post‑order” operation in the API Access Management Migration flow. It is a backup version of the production `PostOrderDetail` model and contains **~150** `String` fields with corresponding getters and setters. The class is used as a data‑carrier between the order‑processing service, database persistence layers, and downstream integration points (e.g., billing, provisioning, partner‑systems). No business logic lives here – it merely mirrors the column layout of the underlying order table or JSON payload.

---

## 2. Important Classes / Functions

| Element | Responsibility |
|---------|-----------------|
| **`PostOrderDetail_bkp` (class)** | Holds every attribute that can be associated with a post‑order record (identifiers, pricing, dates, addresses, partner info, bundle details, etc.). Provides JavaBean‑style getters/setters for each field. |
| **Getters / Setters** (e.g., `getSecsId()`, `setSecsId(String)`) | Enable frameworks (Jackson, JAXB, MyBatis, Spring) to serialize/deserialize the object and to map DB columns to object properties. |
| **`isAdvanceBoo()`, `isProrateBoo()`, …** (named `isXxxBoo` but returning `String`) | Legacy boolean‑style accessors that still return a `String` (“Y”/“N” or similar). Used by downstream code that expects the original string flag. |

*No other methods are present; the class is purely a data container.*

---

## 3. Inputs, Outputs, Side Effects & Assumptions

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Inputs** | Values are populated by: <br>• Database reads (e.g., `SELECT * FROM POST_ORDER_DETAIL …`) <br>• Deserialization of JSON/XML payloads received from upstream order‑capture APIs <br>• Mapping from other model objects (e.g., `PostOrderDetail`) via manual copy or mapping frameworks. |
| **Outputs** | The populated instance is typically: <br>• Serialized back to JSON/XML for downstream services (billing, provisioning). <br>• Passed to DAO/repository layers for INSERT/UPDATE. <br>• Logged or used in audit trails. |
| **Side Effects** | None intrinsic to the class. Side effects arise only from callers that persist the object or send it over the network. |
| **Assumptions** | • All fields are `String`; callers must handle type conversion (dates, numbers, booleans). <br>• Field names match external schema exactly (DB column names, API contract). <br>• The “_bkp” suffix indicates this class is a temporary copy; production code should reference the canonical `PostOrderDetail` class. <br>• No validation is performed here – validation is expected upstream or downstream. |

## 4. Connections to Other Scripts & Components

| Connected Component | How the Connection Occurs |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **`PostOrderDetail` (sibling model)** | Likely copied via a utility or mapper (`BeanUtils.copyProperties`) when the migration code switches from the backup to the live model. |
| **DAO / Repository Layer** (e.g., MyBatis mapper XML) | Field names map 1‑to‑1 to columns in the `POST_ORDER_DETAIL` table; the mapper reads/writes instances of this class. |
| **Serialization Frameworks** (Jackson, Gson) | The class is used as a target for JSON deserialization of order payloads received from external order‑capture APIs. |
| **Service Layer** (`OrderService`, `PostOrderProcessor`) | Business services receive a `PostOrderDetail_bkp` object, enrich it, and forward it to downstream systems (billing, provisioning). |
| **Integration Scripts** (batch jobs, ETL) | Batch scripts that extract order data from legacy systems may instantiate this class to hold rows before bulk loading into the new platform. |
| **Logging / Auditing** | Logging utilities may call `toString()` (generated by IDE) or manually log selected fields for audit trails. |
| **Configuration** | No direct config references; however, the class is part of the `com.tcl.api.model` package that is scanned by Spring (or similar) for component registration. |

*Because the file is a pure model, the “connections” are indirect – they happen wherever the class is used as a method argument or return type.*

## 5. Operational Risks & Recommended Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Massive field count** – >150 `String` members increase memory footprint and risk of typo‑related bugs. | Higher JVM heap usage, slower serialization, harder maintenance. | • Consolidate related fields into sub‑objects (e.g., `Address`, `Pricing`, `PartnerInfo`). <br>• Use Lombok or code‑generation to keep the source concise. |
| **String‑only typing** – dates, numbers, booleans stored as `String`. | Parsing errors at runtime, loss of type safety, locale issues. | • Introduce proper types (`LocalDate`, `BigDecimal`, `boolean`) where feasible. <br>• Add validation/conversion utilities in the service layer. |
| **Duplicate/backup class** – risk of code accidentally using the stale `_bkp` version. | Inconsistent data handling, bugs in production. | • Remove the backup class after migration is verified. <br>• Add a deprecation annotation and CI rule to flag its usage. |
| **No validation** – any value can be set, including null or malformed strings. | Propagation of bad data to downstream systems (billing errors, provisioning failures). | • Implement a validator (e.g., Bean Validation `@NotNull`, `@Pattern`) on the canonical model. |
| **Serialization mismatches** – field names must stay in sync with external contracts. | API breakage, data loss. | • Keep a mapping file (e.g., JSON schema) under version control and generate the POJO from it. |

## 6. Running / Debugging the Class

**Typical developer workflow**

1. **Unit Test Instantiation**  
   ```java
   @Test
   public void testPostOrderDetailBkpCreation() {
       PostOrderDetail_bkp pod = new PostOrderDetail_bkp();
       pod.setSecsId("SEC123");
       pod.setPlanname("PremiumPlan");
       // ... set a few more fields
       assertEquals("SEC123", pod.getSecsId());
   }
   ```

2. **Deserialization Example (Jackson)**  
   ```java
   ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
   PostOrderDetail_bkp pod = mapper.readValue(jsonString, PostOrderDetail_bkp.class);
   ```

3. **Database Mapping (MyBatis)**  
   ```xml
   <resultMap id="PostOrderDetailResult" type="com.tcl.api.model.PostOrderDetail_bkp">
       <result column="SECS_ID" property="secsId"/>
       <!-- repeat for each column -->
   </resultMap>
   ```

4. **Debugging Tips**  
   * Set a breakpoint on any setter to see incoming raw values.  
   * Use `toString()` (auto‑generated or IDE‑generated) to dump the whole object when logging.  
   * Verify that boolean‑style flags (`advanceBoo`, `prorateBoo`, …) contain expected “Y/N” values before passing to downstream services.

**Operator usage** – Operators rarely interact directly with this POJO. Their touch‑points are higher‑level scripts (batch jobs) that read/write CSV/DB rows which are mapped to this class internally.

## 7. External Config / Environment Variables

The class itself does **not** reference any configuration files, environment variables, or external resources. Its usage may be governed by:

| Config Item | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Spring component scan base package** (`com.tcl.api.model`) | Determines whether the class is discovered for injection or mapping. |
| **Database connection properties** (`DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`) | Required by DAO layers that persist instances of this class. |
| **JSON schema files** (if used) | Define the contract that this POJO must satisfy. |

If the project uses a mapping framework (e.g., MapStruct), the corresponding XML/annotation files would reference the class name.

## 8. Suggested TODO / Improvements

1. **Refactor into Typed Sub‑Objects**  
   - Create dedicated classes for logical groups (e.g., `Address`, `PricingInfo`, `PartnerInfo`). Replace the flat `String` fields with typed fields (`LocalDate`, `BigDecimal`, `boolean`). This reduces the class size, improves readability, and enables compile‑time type safety.

2. **Deprecate & Remove the Backup Class**  
   - Add `@Deprecated` annotation with a comment pointing to the canonical `PostOrderDetail`. Introduce a CI rule (e.g., Checkstyle/PMD) that flags any import of `PostOrderDetail_bkp`. Once migration is verified, delete the file to avoid accidental usage.
